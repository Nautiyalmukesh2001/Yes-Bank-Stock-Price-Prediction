# Yes Bank Stock Closing Price Prediction  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting the closing stock price of **Yes Bank** using **time series analysis** and **machine learning techniques**. The objective is to assist investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions by forecasting future price movements and managing risks.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of historical **Yes Bank stock prices**, including:  
- ðŸ“… **Date**  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Open Price**  
- ðŸ“Š **High Price**  
- ðŸ“‰ **Low Price**  
- ðŸ’° **Close Price**  

## Methodology  

### ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing  
âœ” Cleaned and handled missing values  
âœ” Converted date column to a datetime format and set it as an index  

### ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
âœ” Visualized stock price trends and volatility patterns  
âœ” Identified key patterns such as seasonality and cyclic trends  

### ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering  
âœ” Created lagged features for better time series forecasting  
âœ” Implemented rolling window statistics for trend smoothing  

### ðŸ”¹ Model Implementation  
âœ” **Time Series Models:** ARIMA, SARIMA  
âœ” **Machine Learning Models:** Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge  

### ðŸ”¹ Model Evaluation  
âœ” Used **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (RÂ²)** for assessing model accuracy  

## Key Findings  
- **ARIMA & SARIMA:** Captured trends and seasonality well, offering reasonable predictions.  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Regularized models like **Lasso and Ridge** improved predictive accuracy by reducing overfitting.  
- **Challenges:** Exclusion of external factors (e.g., economic indicators, market news) limited model accuracy.  

## Solutions to Business Objective  
âœ” **Risk Management:** Forecasted price fluctuations help investors mitigate risks.  
âœ” **Investment Strategies:** Provides data-driven insights for portfolio optimization.  
âœ” **Market Analysis:** Enhances decision-making by correlating stock performance with financial indicators.  

## Conclusion & Future Work  
âœ” This project demonstrates the effectiveness of **data-driven approaches** in predicting stock prices, despite market volatility.  
âœ” Future improvements can include **macroeconomic data, sentiment analysis**, and **deep learning models** (e.g., LSTMs).  
âœ” While absolute accuracy is challenging, this project helps investors **make informed decisions** with greater confidence.  

## Technologies Used  
ðŸ”¹ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
ðŸ”¹ Statsmodels (ARIMA, SARIMA)  
ðŸ”¹ Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge)
